## 🌿 Why MemoGarden?

MemoGarden is the evolution of two earlier projects—[Reactions](https://github.com/Aliyah2014/Reactions) (a mood board tool) and [Forget-Me-Not](https://github.com/itsemtuk/project-one) (a plant care and reminders app). MemoGarden combines the best of both:  
- **Visual freedom** (drag, drop, resize, rotate, and layer widgets)
- **Collaboration** (real-time sync, presence, sharing, and following)
- **Extensibility** (add new widget types, templates, and more)

Our mission: **Grow a global garden of ideas, together.**
