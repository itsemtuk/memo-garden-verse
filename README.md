# MemoGarden

MemoGarden is a dynamic online notice board or pin board application built with React.js and modern web technologies. It empowers users to create personalized boards where they can add draggable notes, pictures, and other widgets-arranging them freely to suit their creative flow. Users can maintain private boards, explore public ones, or collaborate within groups, fostering a shared space of ideas and inspiration.

## Who Is This For?

MemoGarden is designed for creative individuals, teams, educators, and anyone who benefits from visual organization and collaborative brainstorming. Whether you want a personal digital corkboard to capture thoughts and images or wish to explore and contribute to a global garden of shared boards, MemoGarden adapts to your needs.

## Why MemoGarden?

Inspired by the natural way people use physical notice boards, MemoGarden brings this experience online with enhanced flexibility and collaboration. It builds upon and extends ideas from earlier educational projects-**Reactions** and **Forget-Me-Not**-which focused on mood boards and flashcard learning respectively. MemoGarden merges these concepts into a fresh, interactive platform that supports rich content and social sharing, reflecting years of learning and innovation.

## Evolution from Previous Projects

- **Reactions** ([GitHub](https://github.com/Aliyah2014/Reactions)) introduced a React-based drag-and-drop mood board where users curated images and notes to inspire creativity and productivity.
- **Forget-Me-Not** ([GitHub](https://github.com/itsemtuk/project-one)) focused on educational flashcards to aid memorization and learning efficiency.

MemoGarden is a continuation and expansion of these foundations, combining drag-and-drop interactivity with collaborative and public board features, creating a versatile tool for both personal and group use.
